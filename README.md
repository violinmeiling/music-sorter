# Music Sorter

Access web application here: https://violinmeiling.github.io/music-sorter/

This application uses Spotify's Web API to pull the user's top 50 saved tracks, and users can sort those tracks based on their acousticness, danceability, energy, speechiness, and positivity (valence)

Currently, only users registered with Spotify for Developers can use this app. Once Spotify grants a quota extension (request submitted, approval pending), it will be available for public use
